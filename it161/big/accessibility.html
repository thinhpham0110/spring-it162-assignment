                                <h1>Why accessibility is so important ?</h1>
                                <p class="big__content">
                                        Nowadays, technologies have developed and expanded the users' experiences and focused on the website's
                                        pleasant navigation. However, a much more critical concept-accessibility is also being paid attention to. So,
                                        what is the brief definition of accessibility? According to W3C, "accessibility means that any websites,
                                        tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. More
                                        specifically, people can perceive, understand, navigate, interact with the Web and contribute to the Web." Web
                                        access includes all types of disabilities that can affect navigation on the web auditory, cognitive-motor,
                                        neurological, speech, and visual. Why is web accessibility important? Either the Internet or Web has become a
                                        crucial resource in our life and plays roles in many aspects such as education, employment, government,
                                        commerce, health care, recreation, and more. Thus, web accessibility is essential to promise equal
                                        opportunities and equal access to people that have diverse disabilities. Web accessibility is considered a
                                        basic human right since accessing information, technologies, and communications, including the Web, is a
                                        defined right according to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Web
                                        accessibility can help people with disabilities actively connect to our society in its way.

                                <div class="big__img">
                                        <img src="./images/access.png" alt="Web Accessibility" />
                                </div>
                                <p>
                                        Furthermore, an accessible website offers the possibility of accessing interaction and information that
                                        barriers to print, audio, and visual media can be easily overcome through Web technologies. An accessible
                                        website can contribute to Web design, usability, and search engine optimization (SEO). It can also benefit a
                                        business in a specific case. An accessible design will improve overall user experience and satisfaction,
                                        especially in various situations, across different devices, and older users. Accessibility can enhance our
                                        brand, drive innovation, and extend our market reach. Making the website accessible to people with
                                        disabilities will ensure the possibility of access for everyone. Some of the examples that web developers can
                                        make their webs accessible are trying: the use of Alt-tags, creating better tables by using the caption tag to
                                        make them easier to understand by screen readers rather than just making the title of a table in bold text,
                                        establish useful keyboard navigation, be careful with the use of default HTML Tags, closed captions for media
                                        like consider providing text transcript, always use title tag, and use the ARIA Tag. Having ideas of how vital
                                        accessibility contributes to our websites in mind, we can successfully create and build a website that
                                        promises everyone will access it.
