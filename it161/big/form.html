                                <h1>Why are forms so important in HTML</h1>
                                <p class="big__content">
                                        Websites have grown up along with the evolution of the Internet and modern technology's advent with many new
                                        standards. Nowadays, a successful website should demonstrate and satisfy visitors and user experience with its
                                        performance. A webform is one of the vital aspects that contribute to the overall user experience. A webform
                                        is one of the best ways to get input from prospective clients and indirectly establish a cordial relationship.
                                        Thus, forms are critical in HTML. A web form allows visitors to contact the owner's web page and information,
                                        such as an order, a catalog request, or a query passed on to the database. On some websites, the information
                                        will be transferred directly to the company email after submitted. PHP, HTML, or Java are programming
                                        languages that construct web forms. "A successful implementation of the code is essential for the success of
                                        the form." Examples of web forms are text boxes, text areas, radio buttons, checkboxes, dropdown lists, hidden
                                        fields, file upload, and buttons. Also, a web form is a communication bridge that allows a user to communicate
                                        with a company and vice versa.
                                </p>
                                <div class="big__img">
                                        <img src="./images/form.jpeg" alt="Form" />
                                </div>
                                <p>
                                        A successful web form will help avoid misunderstandings and complications that can harm the company image. For
                                        example, if we want the users to create an account with our website. Asking for a residential address would be
                                        inappropriate and irrelevant. Thus, illogical questions cause confusion and distrust and may lead people not
                                        to complete the signup at all. Knowing how to target audiences and market to frame relevant questions on a web
                                        form is essential; spending time researching what kind of forms will give us some insight into how visitors
                                        think of our website. There are some ways that we can improve the experience of visitors when using web forms.
                                        Informing the visitor of the needed information is the key to give the user's experience perfect on any
                                        respective website. Therefore, it is crucial to inform the visitors about anything they might want to know
                                        about filling in our web forms. We can explain why the visitor needs to fill in such information in our form,
                                        what will happen with the data, or why we ask for specific details. This step will reassure the visitors
                                        comfortable with the web forms, and a chance of getting their sign up is higher. Another way is assisting,
                                        such as adding help text in a subtle and unobstructed way to explain form fields that are not common to the
                                        users. Considering other languages that will be used for the web forms. It will be beneficial if there are
                                        other language options since not everyone who visits our website might be comfortable with our primary
                                        language. Moreover, using multiple languages is a benefit for the company that targets and seeks international
                                        audiences. On the other hand, keeping the web form simple is a good practice; only ask for information that we
                                        need. Trying to order form fields logically or by their importance to make the form look neat and clear our
                                        expectations by showing examples in front of the form field ( ex abc@gmail.com). Try to offer possible default
                                        values and allow users to toggle through the form by using their keyboard. Also, showing clear error messages
                                        is essential such as utilizing the fly error messages to give direct feedback and making instant corrections.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        Finally, providing clear feedback after the user submits data, indicates steps to make the process of filling
                                        in the web form clear, and using color combinations to inform the user about his progress while filling in the
                                        form ( ex red for error or incomplete information and green signifies correct word). In conclusion, a good web
                                        form will boost user's experience in many aspects and improve the connection between users and the websites.
                                        Understanding common mistakes that users will make, giving clear instructions, information on the web page is
                                        a plus for a successful web form. Keeping it clean, simple, and trustworthy is also vital to improving user
                                        experience with our web form.
